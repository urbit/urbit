Urbit
=====

Urbit is a new programming and execution environment designed from scratch. Any
resemblance to existing languages or operating systems is coincidental,
cosmetic, or inevitable.

There is a lot to explain. For more information, watch a [demo screencast][1]
and see the [Urbit website][2].

System Requirements
-------------------

Currently we support OS X, Ubuntu, Debian, and Amazon Linux.

Urbit depends on the following packages:

-  GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
-  OpenSSL
-  libsigsegv
-  ncurses

Building Urbit

See the [documentation][3] for instructions on building and running Urbit.
