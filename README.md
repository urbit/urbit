# Urbit

[Urbit](https://urbit.org) is a personal server stack built from scratch. It
has an identity layer (Azimuth), virtual machine (Vere), and operating system
(Arvo).

A running Urbit "ship" is designed to operate with other ships peer-to-peer.
Urbit is a general-purpose, peer-to-peer computer and network.

This repository contains the [Arvo Kernel][arvo]

For the Runtime, see [Vere][vere].
For more on the identity layer, see [Azimuth][azim].
To manage your Urbit identity, use [Bridge][brid].
