;; hack the mode line
;;----------

;  In the urbit webserver a directory is basically a resource fork,
;  and contains a single file, always named "hymn.hook". Emacs'
;  default buffer-naming will, of course, name this hymn.hook.
;
;  But if you are visitng two files, 5/hymn.hook and 6/hymn.hook, they
;  will both appear the same on the mode line.
;
;  This sucks, and we'd rather have them appear as "5/hymn.hook" and "6/hymn.hook".
;
;  Trivial, right? No.

; The mode line is an interesting beast.
;   1) it's defined in two variables:
;        * mode-line-format, which includes in turn the variable...
;        * mode-line-buffer-identification
;   2) both of these include "magic" string components which
;      constitute a micro-DSL (domain specific language), which includes tags like
;      '%b', indicating that the buffer-name should be substituted in
;      (see emacs variable docs for 'mode-line-format')
;   3) this magic DSL is evaluated by lisp funcs that are written in C
;      and thus which can not be monkey-patched
;        https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Primitive-Function-Type.html
;      translation: "do not sharpen chainsaw while it is running"
;   4) the commands that are executed when the DSL is interpreted are likewise written in C
;
; The upshot is...
;
; WAIT. A better way exists. Instead of hacking the mode-line format,
; just invoke 'rename-buffer, which also lives down in the C
; underbelly. Everything falls out nicely.
