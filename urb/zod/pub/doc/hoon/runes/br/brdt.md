============================

Trap

`|.`, is a synthetic hoon that produces a [dry]() [`%gold`]() trap. A
trap is a [`door`]() with one only arm [`$`](), the empty name.

The default action performed on a trap is kicking it by pulling the arm
`$`. `|.` is similar to `|=` with no arguments. You can think of `|.` as
a function that takes no inputs.

    /~zod/try=> 
    (a)
    42
    /~zod/try=> 
    $:a
    42

This is a simple example. We assign a shell variable `a` to be a trap
that simply produces the atom `42`. Printing `a` prints the core and its
context. Calling `a` using `(`, the irregular form of [`%-`](), produces
its value. As does pulling the arm `$` from inside it using `$:a`.

    /~zod/try=> 
    =a  10
    changed %a
    /~zod/try=> 
    =b  |.  (add a 2)
    changed %b
    /~zod/try=> 
    (b)
    12

In this case we assign a variable `a` to be `10`, and create a trap `b`
to add `2` to it. This is a trivial example, but is meant to show that
traps are useful when you need a gate that only operates on values that
are already in its context.

    /~zod/try=> 
    =loop  =+  reps=10
           =+  step=0
           =+  outp=0
           |.
           ?:  =(step reps)
             outp
           $(outp (add outp 2), step +(step))
    changed %loop
    /~zod/try=> (loop)
    20

Expanding on our previous example, we create a trap with three local
variables, `reps`, `step`, and `outp`. We use a trap to create a loop,
testing each time if `step` is equal to `reps`, if so producing `outp`
otherwise calling our trap again with `outp` replaced with `outp+2`, and
`step` incremented.
