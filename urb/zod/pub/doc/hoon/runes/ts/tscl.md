tiscol, `=:`, %tscl
============================

Batch change subject

`=:` is a synthetic hoon that produces `q` with the subject modified by
the list of changes in `p` which must be terminated by a `==`. `=:` is
useful when you need to make a batch of changes to your subject.

Examples

    ~zod/try=> =+  a=[b=1 c=2]
               =:  c.a  4
                   b.a  3
                 ==
               a
    [b=3 c=4]

Here we add a simple cell with faces to our subject, `a=[b=1 c=2]` and
make a set of changes to it using `=:`.
