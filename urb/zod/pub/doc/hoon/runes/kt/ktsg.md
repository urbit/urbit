ketsig, `^~`, %ktsg
============================

Compile statically

`^~` is a natural hoon that tries to execute `p` statically at compile
time; if this fails, `p` remains dynamic. `^~` is primarily useful for
optimization, when you know that a value is static, or is most likely
static, `^~` can simplify the compilation.

Produces
--------

Twig: `[%ktsg p=twig]`

Sample
------

`p` is a [twig]().

Tall form
---------

    ^~  a

Wide form
---------

    ^~(a)

Irregular form
--------------

None

Examples
--------

    /~zod/try=> (make '|-(42)')
    [%8 p=[%1 p=[1 42]] q=[%9 p=2 q=[%0 p=1]]]
    /~zod/try=> (make '^~(|-(42))')
    [%1 p=42]

Here we use [`++make`]() to examine the nock generated for a particular
computation. We start with a simple kicked trap, `|-` that just
generates the static value `42`. When we wrap our `|-` in a `^~` you can
see that our compilation is much simpler.
