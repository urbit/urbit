# Hoon

Hoon is a strict, typed, pure functional language.  This site is
served by an urbit written in Hoon.

If you're interested in learning the fundamentals of Hoon from
the bottom up, start with [Principles of
Hoon](hoon/principles).

If you want to jump into building things right away and prefer to
learn from the top down, check out [Leap into
Hoon](hoon/leap-in/basic).

Both of these are under active development.
