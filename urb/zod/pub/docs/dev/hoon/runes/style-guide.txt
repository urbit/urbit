Still to do
-----------

- switch out pull to call
- switch out function for gate
- put back in the zay runes
- put in `` in all [++*]()
- add link syntax to references to virtual rune


- put links in


Conventions
-----------------

1. if there's a word that's not immediately clear it should be linked to, but only the first instance (per definition).

2. when you're linking to a library function, include the ++.

  - when you've already linked to a name in the library, the next instance of that name on that page should not have a prepended ++ nor any sort of link or demarcation (``).

3. when linking to the glossary, ++ should be omitted.

4. mold and span should be linked to and immediately explained somewhere, but everything else should be explained in plain english.

5. the only hoon words that should be used instead of commonspeak are those that *really* have the potential to confuse people. As of now:

  - span
  - mold

For all other hoon words, give an english explanation and then use the hoon word in parens after. The one exception to this is in the one-liner descriptions where it's impossible to use regular english to concisely explain a concept. For example, $| is unbunt.


Checklist for every rune
------------------------

  - one liner

  - one or two explanations, depending on whether they're redundant. In other words, does longform description make sense?
  
  - ensure it's properly formatted

  - examples are good

General things that need attention
----------------------------------

1. Don't know if the 'Produces' section for the majority of the rune sections are actually helpful. If they are not, 


2. I cleaned up the # runes a little bit but need someone to go over the entirety of both of those pages.

3. In the ^ section, I'm not sure my language is 100% correct. For example: 'cast q to the type of p'. Should I say this, or should I say span of p, (or even mold?). To be safe, please checkout all of the descriptions in this seciton.

4. While i did clean it up a little, the entirety of the ~ section should be checked by someone more qualified.

  - ~/ needs an explanation
  - not sure ~= one-liner is good enough.
  - ~% needs an explanation for p thru s
  - p in ~& is confusing, because we say it's a @ud, but in all the examples its a number of >.

5. The ; runes need another set of eyes.

  - not sure if the ;~ examples are explained correctly.

  - help with ;;

Specific things that need to be added or checked out
----------------------------------------------------

0. Don't know which mold words are going away (%reed, etc)--someone else will have to take care of that.

1. $: needs more about how it validates tuples that have some matching cases. Examples should also be used to clarify.

2. Examples for $&

3. Look at the irregular form portion of $=; is the 'note' correct?

4. Please checkout my $= description, not sure if it's entirely accurate.

5. In the 'accepts' section of |_, I say that p is a mold, because that's what the person needs to input. However, I believe the answer that is *actually* correct is that 'p is a twig that produces a mold'. Can't make the call here.

6. I feel like we should highlight natural runes in a different color.

7. Please checkout the definition of |.

8. See the 'XX' in |/.

9. Don't know what a book is please checkout |^

10. Need help with `:/`

11. We don't still use `%:`, do we

12. checkout

13. can we get rid of ^&. If not, please check it out.

14. Not sure if my ^. explanation is correct.

15. Fill in the XX in ^?. Basically, need an explanation when it's useful. think i get it but am not sure.

16. Checkout the explanation of tanks in ~_. Not sure if it's correct.

17. Could be cool to show the breakdown of =+. Too tired to right now :p

18. For ?., could be useful to show example where ?. keeps things cleaner. Again, too tired.

19. No idea on %wthz, %wtkz, %wtlz, %wtpz, %wtsz, %wttz

20. Help with !, &u[date] !/
