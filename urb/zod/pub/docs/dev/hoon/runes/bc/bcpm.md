`$&` 
====

Union of two cells: one w/cellular head & other w/atomic head

Produces a [mold]() that's a union between two different kinds of
noun: a cell whose head is a cell (`p`), and cell whose head is
an atom (`q`). Its default value ([bunt]()) is the same as the
default value of `q`.  One important use of `$&` is to implement
autocons in [`++twig`]().

Produces
--------

Default value is the bunt of `q`.

Accepts

A mold of a cell whose head is a cell `p` and a mold of a cell
whose head is an atom `q`.
