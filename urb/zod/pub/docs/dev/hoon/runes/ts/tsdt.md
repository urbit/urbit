`=.`
====

Produces `r` with `p` in the subject set to `q`.

Allows you to change a value in your subject before executing
more code against it.  Even though hoon is purely functional, and
thus has no true mutation, this is essentially variable mutation.

Technically, `=.` is a synthetic rune that produces `r` with `p` in the
subject set to `q`.

Produces
--------

Twig: `[%tsdt p=wing q=twig r=twig]`

Accepts
-------

`p` is a [`wing`](). `q` and `r` are [`twig`]()s.

Tall form
---------

    =.  p 
      q
    r

    =.  p  q
    r

Wide form
---------

    =.(p q r)

Examples
--------

    ~zod/try=> =+  a=[b=1 c=2]
               =.  b.a  3
               a
    [b=3 c=2]
    ~zod/try=> =+  a=[b=1 c=2]
               =.(b.a 3 a)
    [b=3 c=2]

Here we see the tall and wide forms of `=.` used to manipulate our
simple subject `a=[b=1 c=2]`.
