`;;`
====

Fixpoint, assert type.

The most common usage is to assert that a value is of a
particular type, crashing if we're wrong.  This is equivalent to
[`++hard`]().

Technicaly, `;;` is a synthetic rune that types `q` as a fixpoint
of `p`.  More specifically, `;;` slams `q` through gate `p`,
asserting that the resulting noun [`.=`]() the original, and
produces it.
