I. Things to discuss

Phil:

- we are in need of a separate sail section.

- do we use (or assume that people  words like 'subject'? Confusing to use context and 'context.' See `=:`. Should we use stack?

- what's the best way to explain 'changes to the context' followed by `q` evalauted? `=^`
- where do we explain backstep.

- how do we explain the type system? We really need to cover
  that. The ?~ can't find limb $ could be trick for people. 


Galen:

- links (glossary)

- Change all mold -> mold and icon -> span 


- do we want to include sections on Kingside and Queenside (ie

- needs to be consistency among links to arms--do we use ++ or
  not?

- probably should go through to check out redundant explanations

- need to go over Produces section for all runes.
