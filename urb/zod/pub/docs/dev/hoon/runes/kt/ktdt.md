`^.`
====

Cast `q` to product type of `p`

Casts `q` to the product of calling `p` on any data. The same as
casting `q` to the product type of `p`. Useful when you want to
cast to the type of a function that you don't want to actually
run at runtime.

Produces
--------

Twig: `[%ktdt p=twig q=twig]`

Accepts
-------

`p` is a [`++twig`](). `q` is a twig.

Tall form
---------

    ^.  p
    q

Examples
--------

    /~zod/try=> =cor  |=  [~ a=@]
          [~ p=a]
    changed %cor
    /~zod/try=> ^.(cor [~ 97])
    [~ p=97]

In this example we create a function `cor` that takes a cell of `~` and an
atom and produces `[~ p=a]`. Using `^.` we can cast without calling
`cor` and produce the same result.
