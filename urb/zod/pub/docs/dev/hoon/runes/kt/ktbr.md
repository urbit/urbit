`^|`
====

Make core context unreadable

Converts a core to a core whose [context]() is unreadable. Useful
in preventing type fails when replacing one core with one context
with another core with a different context. In hoon-specific
terminonlogy, `^|` is a natural rune that converts a [`%gold`]()
core into an [`%iron`]() core.

`p` is a [`++twig`]().

Examples
--------

    /~zod/try=> =cor  |=  a=@
          +(a)
    new var %cor
    /~zod/try=> +<.cor
    a=0
    /~zod/try=> =iro  ^|(cor)
    new var %iro
    /~zod/try=> +<.iro
    ! -axis.6
    ! peek-park
    ! exit

Here we crete a simple gate and assign it to the shell variable
`cor`.  We can examine the sample of `cor` with `+<` (the
[head]() of the [tail]()) to produce `a=0`. Assigning a new shell
variable, `iro` as the `^|` of `cor` we can no longer peek in to
its subject.
