Pronunciation
=============

Overview
--------

Hoon is a reserved-word-free
language - any text in the program is part of the program.

We use so many of these ASCII glyphs that we like to be able
to read them out loud.  A language is meant to be _said_.  The
squiggles have conventional names, sort of, some of them easy to
say, others not so much.  So we've renamed them:
 
    ace  space
    bar  | 
    bas  \ 
    buc  $ 
    cab  _ 
    cen  % 
    col  : 
    com  , 
    doq  " 
    dot  . 
    fas  / 
    gal  <
    gar  >
    hax  #
    hep  -
    kel  {
    ker  }
    ket  ^
    lus  +
    pam  &
    pat  @
    pel  (
    per  )
    sel  [
    sem  ;
    ser  ]
    sig  ~
    soq  '
    tar  *
    tec  `
    tis  =
    wut  ?
    zap  !

Memorizing these names seems like a burden, but it actually makes 
communicating about hoon code a lot faster and easier. `bartis` 
sounds a lot better than 'bar equals'.

To pronounce a rune, concatenate the glyph names, stressing the
first syllable and softening the second vowel into a "schwa."
Hence, to say `~.`, say "sigdot."  To say `|=`, say "bartis."
Which has an inevitable tendency to turn into "barts" - a sin
to be encouraged. 

There are a few runes with irregular special pronunciations:

    --    hephep    phep    
    +-    lushep    slep
    ++    luslus    slus
    ==    tistis    stet
    ->    hepgar    lark     
    -<    hepgal    lush
    +>    lusgar    dark
    +<    lusgal    dush
