  Handles sending packets to galaxies. We need to get their IP addresses
  from DNS, which is more complicated.

-- Asynchronous thread per galaxy which handles domain resolution, and can
-- block its own queue of ByteStrings to send.
--
-- Maybe perform the resolution asynchronously, injecting into the resolver
-- queue as a message.
--
-- TODO: Figure out how the real haskell time library works.

-- We've failed to lookup the IP. Drop the outbound packet
-- because we have no IP for our galaxy, including possible
-- previous IPs.

{-
- Sending Packets to Galaxies.
  - Each galaxy has it's own DNS resolution thread.
  - Initially, no threads are started.
  - To send a message to a galaxy,
    - Check to see if it already has a resolution thread.
    - If it does, pass the packet to that thread.
    - If it doesn't, start a new thread and give it the packet.
- Galaxy resolution threads work as follows:
  - First, they are given:
    - They know which galaxy they are responsible for.
    - They have access to the turfs TVar (shared state with Ames driver).
    - They can be given packets (to be send to their galaxy).
    - They must be given a way to send UDP packets.
  - Next, we loop forever
    - In the loop we track:
      - the last-known IP address.
      - the time when we last looked up the IP address.
    - We wait to be given a packet.
    - We get the IP address.
      - If we looked up the IP address in the last 5 minute, use the
        cached IP address.
        - Just use the one from last time.
      - Otherwise,
        - Do a DNS lookup.
        - Go through the turf list one item at a time.
          - Try each one.
            - If it resolves to one-or-more IP addresses,
              - Use the first one.
            - If it resolves to zero IP addresses, move on to the next turf.
          - If none of the turfs can be used to resolve the IP address,
            then we don't know where the galaxy is.
            - Drop the packet.
