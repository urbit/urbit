  Until born events succeeds, ignore effects.
  Wait until born event callbacks invoked.
    If success, signal success.
    If failure, try again several times.
      If still failure, bring down ship.
   Once born event succeeds, hold on to effects.
   Once all other drivers have booted:
     - Execute stashed effects.
     - Begin normal operation (start accepting requests)
