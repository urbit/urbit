/* u3_daemon_init(): platform-specific daemon mode initialization.

  We use a pipe to communicate between the child and the parent. The
  parent waits for the child to write something to the pipe and
  then exits. If the pipe is closed with nothing written to it, get
  the exit status from the child process and also exit with that status.

  We want the child to write to the pipe once it's booted, so we put
  `_on_boot_completed_cb` into `u3_Host.bot_f`, which is NULL in
  non-daemon mode. That gets called once the `chis` service is
  available.

  In both processes, we are good fork() citizens, and close all unused
  file descriptors. Closing `pipefd[1]` in the parent process is
  especially important, since the pipe needs to be closed if the child
  process dies. When the pipe is closed, the read fails, and that's
  how we know that something went wrong.

  There are some edge cases around `WEXITSTATUS` that are not handled
  here, but I don't think it matters.
