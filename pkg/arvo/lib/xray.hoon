::  # Type Analysis
::
::  This does analysis on types to produce an `ximage` value, which can
::  be used to print the type (with `ximage-to-spec`) or to print values
::  of that type (using the `libpprint` library).  You should understand
::  the `ximage` type before digging further.
::
::  `xray-type` is the main gate of interest here. It's implemented as a
::  series of passes:
::
::  - `analyze-type`: This takes a `type`, which is a lazily-evaluated,
::     recursive xdat structure, and converts it into an explicit
::     graph. It also collect the information from `%hint` types and
::     decorates the graph nodes with that.
::
::  - `cleanup`: Removes `%pntr` nodes, replacing references to them
::    with references to what they resolve to.
::
::  - `decorate-ximage-with-loops`: Determines which nodes reference
::    themselves recursively.
::
::  - `decorate-ximage-with-xpats`: Adds printing heuristics to types:
::    "Should this be printed as a list?"
::
::  - `decorate-ximage-with-xshapes`: Determines the loose shape of each
::    type. This overlaps with, and is used by, the next pass. Doing
::    this as a separate pass removes a lot of difficult edge-cases when
::    determining the `xrole` of cell-types.
::
::  - `decorate-ximage-with-xroles`: Restructures forks to make them
::    coherent. This is important both for printing types (we want to use
::    `$@` `$%` `$%`, etc) and for printing xdat (we need an efficient
::    way to determine which branch of a fork matches a value.
::
::  # Todos
::
::  - XX It seems (have'nt verified this) that there's a lot of things
::    that are forks that, once void types have been factored out,
::    only actually refer to one thing. It would be nice to discover
::    things of this kind and replace such fork node with the thing the
::    actualy resolve to.
::
::    The reason I think this is what's happening is that I see lots
::    of %unexpected-fork-xrole messages when converting the kernel type
::    to a spec, and those xroles have things like %tall and %atom.
::    However! The `combine` function never produces anything with
::    those xroles.
::
::  - XX Create xpats and matchers %map %set.
::
::  - XX Create xpats and matchers for tuples. There's no need to
::    recreate this structure in the printing code, and that's what we're
::    doing now.
::
::  - XX The xpat of an xray could be computed on demand instead of
::    up-front. Possibly a lot faster!
::
::  - XX The loop-detection of an xray could be done on demand instead
::    of up-front. Possibly a lot faster!
::
::  - XX The xpat matching code is basically brute-force.
::
::    If it turns out to be a performance bottleneck, there's lots of
::    low-hanging fruit there. For example:
::
::    - Faces repeat the work done for the type they reference.
::    - When detecting whether a cell is part of an "informal" list,
::      we recurse into the tail repeatedly. For example, the following
::      example will do the "formal-list" test 3 times:
::
::      - `[1 2 `(list @)`~]`
::
::  - XX Try to find a way to drop the `%pntr` constructor from
::    `%xdat`. The consumer of an `xray` does not care.
::
::  - XX Actually, it would also be really nice to produce another
::    version of this structure that doesn't have the (unit *) wrapper around
::    everything interesting. This would make the on-demand computation
::    of various things hard, though.
::
::  - XX Simply lying about the type of deep arms is not robust. I am just
::    claiming that they are nouns, but if another thing in the xray
::    actually needs it, it will think it's a noun too.
::
::  - XX There are probably remaining bugs. Test the shit out of this.
::
::  - XX What should the `xrole` of a cell with a %noun head be? I
::    think the current design can't handle this case coherently.

::  Detect loops.
::
::  This works by simply recursing through all the references within an
::  xray while keeping an explicit recursion stack: If we hit a node
::  that's in the stack, that's a loop. If we touch everything without
::  hitting a recursive reference, then it's not a loop.
::
::  Is the short-circuiting sound? I'm not sure now.
::
::    - When could it go wrong?
::    - This graph, for example:
::
::      ```
::      x -> y
::      y -> z
::      y -> y
::      z -> x
::      ```
::
::    - Let's say we process this starting with y, we will see that `y`
::      is a loop, and then when we go to process x, recursing into y will be
::      short-circuited since its `loop` field is already set.
::
::    - Well, maybe `x` will have been recognized as a loop during the
::      processing of `x`? I think it depends on whether we continue
::      to trace through all references from `y` even after we've found
::      a loop, and I think we do.
::
::    - Put another way, this will recurse into everything referenced
::      by a type, and only mark loops once it's encountered them:
::      After processing a type, every type that it references
::      (transitive closure) will have been processed correctly.

::  Determine the `xrole` of each xray node, restructuring forks to make
::  them coherent.
::
::  This is fairly simple for non-role types, and we handle forks the
::  same way we do with `xshape` detection. The basic move is to get all
::  of the non-fork branches using `xray-branches`, make a list of them,
::  and fold a function over that. However, the function we're folding with
::  is MUCH more complicated.
::
::  One of the big sources of complexity is that we need to restructure
::  the shape of forks, so we will be creating a bunch of new graph
::  nodes, and rearranging them. For example, if we want to merge a
::  junction (a fork of an atom and a cell) with an atom type, we create
::  a new junction xray that is a fork of the old cell type and the
::  union of the two cell types. The function we fold with is `merge`,
::  but the bulk of the logic lives in `combine`.
::
::  Here's some pseudocode for the essence of the logic that we're
::  trying to implement here. Note that the code is actually shaped
::  quite differently than this and is much more detailed. So, try
::  to wrap your head around WHY this makes sense instead of just
::  trying to use this a map for the actual code.
