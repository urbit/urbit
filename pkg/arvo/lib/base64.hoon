::
::  Encode an `octs` into a base64 string.
::
::  First, we break up the input into a list of 24-bit words. The input
::  might not be a multiple of 24-bits, so we add 0-2 padding bytes at
::  the end (to the least-significant side, with a left-shift).
::
::  Then, we encode each block into four base64 characters.
::
::  Finally we remove the padding that we added at the beginning: for
::  each byte that was added, we replace one character with an = (unless
::  `pad` is false, in which case we just remove the extra characters).
