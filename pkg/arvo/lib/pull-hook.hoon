::  lib/pull-hook: helper for creating a push hook
::  
::   lib/pull-hook is a helper for automatically pulling data from a
::   corresponding push-hook to a store. 
::   
::   ## Interfacing notes:
::
::   The inner door may interact with the library by producing cards.
::   Do not pass any cards on a wire beginning with /helper as these
::   wires are reserved by this library. Any watches/pokes/peeks not
::   listed below will be routed to the inner door.
::
::   ##  Subscription paths
::
::   /tracking: The set of resources we are pulling
::
::   ##  Pokes
::
::   %pull-hook-action: Add/remove a resource from pulling.
