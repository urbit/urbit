  ::  channel: connection to the browser

  ::    Channels are the main method where a webpage communicates with Gall
  ::    apps. Subscriptions and pokes are issues with PUT requests on a path,
  ::    while GET requests on that same path open a persistent EventSource
  ::    channel.
  ::
  ::    The EventSource API is a sequence number based API that browser provide
  ::    which allow the server to push individual events to the browser over a
  ::    connection held open. In case of reconnection, the browser will send a
  ::    'Last-Event-Id: ' header to the server; the server then resends all
  ::    events since then.

  ::
  ::  Azimuth points form a groupoid, where the objects are all the
  ::  possible values of +point and the arrows are the possible values
  ::  of (list point-diff).  Composition of arrows is concatenation,
  ::  and you can apply the diffs to a +point with +apply.
  ::
  ::  It's simplest to consider +point as the coproduct of three
  ::  groupoids, Rift, Keys, and Sponsor.  Recall that the coproduct
  ::  of monoids is the free monoid (Kleene star) of the coproduct of
  ::  the underlying sets of the monoids.  The construction for
  ::  groupoids is similar.  Thus, the objects of the coproduct are
  ::  the product of the objects of the underlying groupoids.  The
  ::  arrows are a list of a sum of the diff types of the underlying
  ::  groupoids.  Given an arrow=(list diff), you can project to the
  ::  underlying arrows with +skim filtering on the head of each diff.
  ::
  ::  The identity element is ~.  Clearly, composing this with any
  ::  +diff gives the original +diff.  Since this is a category,
  ::  +compose must be associative (true, because concatenation is
  ::  associative).  This is a groupoid, so we must further have that
  ::  every +point-diff has an inverse.  These are given by the
  ::  +inverse operation.
