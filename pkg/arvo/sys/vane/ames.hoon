::    Ames extends Arvo's %pass/%give move semantics across the network.
::
::    Ames receives packets as Arvo events and emits packets as Arvo
::    effects.  The runtime is responsible for transferring the bytes in
::    an Ames packet across a physical network to another ship.
::
::    The runtime tells Ames which physical address a packet came from,
::    represented as an opaque atom.  Ames can emit a packet effect to
::    one of those opaque atoms or to the Urbit address of a galaxy
::    (root node), which the runtime is responsible for translating to a
::    physical address.  One runtime implementation sends UDP packets
::    using IPv4 addresses for ships and DNS lookups for galaxies, but
::    other implementations may overlay over other kinds of networks.
::
::    A local vane can pass Ames a %plea request message.  Ames
::    transmits the message over the wire to the peer ship's Ames, which
::    passes the message to the destination vane.
::
::    Once the peer has processed the %plea message, it sends a
::    message-acknowledgment packet over the wire back to the local
::    Ames.  This ack can either be positive to indicate the request was
::    processed, or negative to indicate the request failed, in which
::    case it's called a "nack".  (Don't confuse Ames nacks with TCP
::    nacks, which are a different concept).
::
::    When the local Ames receives either a positive message-ack or a
::    combination of a nack and naxplanation (explained in more detail
::    below), it gives an %done move to the local vane that had
::    requested the original %plea message be sent.
::
::    A local vane can give Ames zero or more %boon response messages in
::    response to a %plea, on the same duct that Ames used to pass the
::    %plea to the vane.  Ames transmits a %boon over the wire to the
::    peer's Ames, which gives it to the destination vane on the same
::    duct the vane had used to pass the original %plea to Ames.
::
::    %boon messages are acked automatically by the receiver Ames.  They
::    cannot be nacked, and Ames only uses the ack internally, without
::    notifying the client vane that gave Ames the %boon.
::
::    If the Arvo event that completed receipt of a %boon message
::    crashes, Ames instead sends the client vane a %lost message
::    indicating the %boon was missed.
::
::    %plea messages can be nacked, in which case the peer will send
::    both a message-nack packet and a naxplanation message, which is
::    sent in a way that does not interfere with normal operation.  The
::    naxplanation is sent as a full Ames message, instead of just a
::    packet, because the contained error information can be arbitrarily
::    large.  A naxplanation can only give rise to a positive ack --
::    never ack an ack, and never nack a naxplanation.
::
::    Ames guarantees a total ordering of messages within a "flow",
::    identified in other vanes by a duct and over the wire by a "bone":
::    an opaque number.  Each flow has a FIFO queue of %plea requests
::    from the requesting ship to the responding ship and a FIFO queue
::    of %boon's in the other direction.
::
::    Message order across flows is not specified and may vary based on
::    network conditions.
::
::    Ames guarantees that a message will only be delivered once to the
::    destination vane.
::
::    Ames encrypts every message using symmetric-key encryption by
::    performing an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman using our private key
::    and the public key of the peer.  For ships in the Jael PKI
::    (public-key infrastructure), Ames looks up the peer's public key
::    from Jael.  Comets (128-bit ephemeral addresses) are not
::    cryptographic assets and must self-attest over Ames by sending a
::    single self-signed packet containing their public key.
::
::    When a peer suffers a continuity breach, Ames removes all
::    messaging state related to it.  Ames does not guarantee that all
::    messages will be fully delivered to the now-stale peer.  From
::    Ames's perspective, the newly restarted peer is a new ship.
::    Ames's guarantees are not maintained across a breach.
::
::    A vane can pass Ames a %heed $task to request Ames track a peer's
::    responsiveness.  If our %boon's to it start backing up locally,
::    Ames will give a %clog back to the requesting vane containing the
::    unresponsive peer's urbit address.  This interaction does not use
::    ducts as unique keys.  Stop tracking a peer by sending Ames a
::    %jilt $task.
::
::    Debug output can be adjusted using %sift and %spew $task's.
