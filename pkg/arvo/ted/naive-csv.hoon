::  naive-csv: produces csv file containing L2 transaction data
::
::    takes in the network to use and the ethereum node url to grab data from.
::    it starts with the azimuth snapshot and scries the logs from %azimuth.
::    it then produces a csv file containing the following data on L2
::    transactions:
::
::    - block number
::    - timestamp
::    - roller address
::    - roll hash
::    - tx hash
::    - sending ship
::    - sending proxy
::    - nonce
::    - gas price
::    - length of input data
::    - success or failure
::    - function name
::    - spawning ship (^sein:title)
::
::    A lot of the data-scrounging here is stuff that %roller already keeps track
::    of. We could just scry it from there, but then this thread needs to be run
::    on the roller ship. So we rebuild the list of historical transactions
::    ourselves so that this can run from any ship.
