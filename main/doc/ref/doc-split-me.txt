    ++  stub 
        Declares the current Hoon version number in degrees Kelvin.

        In Kelvin versioning -the true Martian way to permanently freeze a
        system- releases count down by integer degrees Kelvin. At absolute
        zero, the system can no longer be changed.  At 1K, one more
        modification is possible. And so on.

    ++  term  
        A restricted text atom for Hoon constants. The only characters
        permitted are lowercase ASCII, - except as the first or last character,
        and 0-9 except as the first character.

        The syntax for @tas is the text itself, always preceded by %. This
        means a term is always cubical. You can cast it to @tas if you like,
        but we just about always want the cube:
        ---
        ~zod/try=> %dead-fish9

        ---
        The empty @tas has a special syntax, $:

        ~zod/try=> %$
        %$
        ---
        A term without % is not a constant, but a name:

        ~zod/try=> dead-fish9
        ! -find-limb.dead-fish9
        ! find-none
        ! exit

    ++  tiki

    ++  tile  

        A tile is a convenient way of making a well-typed noun.  It can be
        reduced in four ways - cryptically called bunt, clam,
        fish, and whip. each tile corresponds to a well-defined
        type, called its icon. A tile is converted statically into a twig,
        which in turn may (depending on the conversion) produce the icon, test
        for it, etc. And always, the icon is some function of the tile and its
        subject.
        ---
        There are nine cases within ++tile:

        [p=tile q=tile]

            Tiles autocons, just like twigs - a cell of tiles is a tile of a
            cell. 

            (,[@ @] [4 5]) is [4 5], which is the same as [(,@ 4) (,@ 5)],
            producing [4 5]. Clearly, (,[@ @] [4 5])  should not be the same as
            [(,@ [4 5]) (,@ [4 5])] - which would produce merely [0 0].)

            The irregular wide syntax for tile autocons is the same as the
            syntax for twig autocons - eg, [@ @], a cell of atoms. But there is
            also a regular tall/wide tuple syntax, with $: (buccol, %bccl).
            Thus instead of [@ @] we could write:

            $:  @ 
                @ 
            ==

        [%axil p=base]

            An %axil is a simple built-in mechanism for a few basic icons: an
            atom of any odor (@odor, or just @ for the odorless base atom); a
            noun (*); a cell of nouns (^); a loobean ?; and null ~.

        [%bark p=term q=tile]

            Wrap a name round a tile. a=* parses as [%bark %a %noun].

            This is another case where the tile syntax matches the twig syntax,
            but only in the irregular form. The twig equivalent of %bark is of
            course ^= (kettis, %ktts). But the tile is $= (buctis):

            $=  a
            *

            Obviously a silly syntactic arrangement. But you can need it if q
            is really big.

        [%bush p=tile q=tile]

            A %bush is a tile in which there are two kinds of nouns: cells
            whose head is a cell (tile p) and cells whose head is an atom (tile
            q). Its default value is the value of q.

            We don't have to look very far to find a %bush - ++tile is one, as
            is ++twig and ++nock. The rune is $& (bucpam). See ++tile above - p
            is [p=tile q=tile], q is the $%. There is no irregular form.

            What's the use of a %bush? Often in a variety of data structures we
            have something like autocons, in which forming a cell of two
            instances has an obvious default semantics.

            Sure, we could attach these semantics to an atom, and just use a
            %kelp. In twigs, tiles, or nock formulas, we could have an explicit
            cons stem of some sort. But it would be a bulky as compared to
            autocons.

        [%fern p=[i=tile t=(list tile)]]

            A %fern is a non-empty list of cases; its icon is naturally a
            %fork. The programmer is responsible for ensuring that the cases
            are actually orthogonal (unlike with the structured forks, %bush,
            %kelp and %reed). A good general practice is to use %ferns only
            with %leafs.

            For example, a fern that could be %foo or %bar has the irregular
            form ?(%foo %bar), or the regular form

            $?  %foo
                %bar
            ==

            The default value is the first - in this case, %foo.

        [%kelp p=[i=line t=(list line)]]          

            A kelp is the workhorse of tiles - it provides the most common data
            structure in any language, the discriminated union. 

            In Hoon, the head (which must be a leaf) is called the stem. The
            tail (which can be anything) is the bulb. Cases of a kelp are known
            inevitably as fronds. 

            (Yes. We're aware that "kelp" is not properly a singular noun. In
            Hoon - it is properly a singular noun. And that's that. And oddly,
            it's not that hard to run out of four-letter plants.)

            $%, buccen, is a tile rune that produces a %kelp. $% takes a list
            of lines, which are labelled cases, closed by ==.
                                                  
            $%  p 
                q 
            ==
        [%leaf p=term q=@]

            A %leaf is an atomic constant of value q and odor p. Obviously its
            icon is a %cube.

            The syntax for a leaf is the same as the twig syntax, except that %
            is never required to generate a cube. For instance, as a twig, 7
            has a type of [%atom %ud]; %7 has a type of [%cube 7 [%atom %ud]].
            But the icon of the leaf 7 is, again, [%cube 7 [%atom %ud]].

        [%reed p=tile q=tile]

            A %reed is a tile whose icon contains two kinds of nouns: atoms of
            tile p and cells of tile q.

            There is no irregular form of %reed. The regular form is:

            $|  ~ [@ @] ==

            or in wide mode $|(~ [@ @])

        [%herb p=twig]

            You can write your own tile which is just a gate, accepting a
            sample of * and normalizing it as you choose. If you use a twig as
            a tile, it's treated as an herb.

            For example, when we define a gate like ++base, as defined above
            (remember that when we use a tile as a twig, we get the clam, ie,
            the normalizing gate) base is just an arm which produces a gate.
            Nothing has any idea that this gate is built from a tile of its
            own.

            So when we parse [p=base q=base] as a tile, the parser builds the
            noun:

            [[%bark %p %herb %cnzy %base] [%bark %q %herb %cnzy %base]] In
            other words, base in p=base is actually a twig, but this twig
            happens to produce a normalizing gate generated by clamming a tile.
            In time this will come to seem totally straightforward, but don't
            be surprised if it confuses you now.

            The important thing to remember about %herb is that the actual twig
            we provide will be applied when we whip or clam. Hence, arbitrary
            normalization and/or verification procedures may be part of the
            herbaceous custom tile.

        An XML template tree.  

        Leaf %a contains plain-text, %b an empty tag, %c a static list, %d a 
        dynamic list, %e a full node element containing a twig and a list of
        tuna, and %f is a empty node.
        
    ++  twig    TODO: delete Form, normalize indentation

        A twig is an abstract syntax tree or AST, which we produce when we
        parse a Hoon expression, file, etc.  A twig is a noun that's converted
        into a Nock formula, with the assistance of a type which describes the
        subject of the formula:

        [subject-type twig] => formula

        But actually this isn't quite right, because Hoon does something called
        "type inference." When we have a type that describes the subject for
        the formula we're trying to generate, as we generate that formula we
        want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that
        subject. So our compiler computes:

        [subject-type twig] => [product-type formula]

        As long as subject-type is a correct description of some subject, you
        can take any twig and compile it against subject-type, producing a
        formula such that *(subject formula) is a product correctly described
        by product-type.

        Actually, this works well enough that in Hoon there is no direct syntax
        for defining or declaring a type. There is only a syntax for
        constructing twigs. Types are always produced by inference.

        A type is a noun that:

        One, it defines a set of nouns. Any finite noun is either in this set, or
        not in it.

        Two, it ascribes semantics to all nouns in this set. For example, a Hoon
        type exports a semantic namespace.

        A lot of other languages use dynamic types, in which the type of a
        value is carried along with the data as you use it. Even languages like
        Lisp, which are nominally typeless, look rather typed from the Hoon
        perspective. For example, a Lisp atom knows dynamically whether it's a
        symbol or an integer. A Hoon atom is just a Nock atom, which is just a
        number. So without a static type, Hoon doesn't even know how to print
        an atom properly.
        ---
        
        There are 9 cases of ++type:

        ?(%noun %void)

            Either %noun or %void. %noun is the set of all nouns. %void is the
            set of no nouns. 

            ~zod/try=> :type; *
            0
            *

            ~zod/try=> -:!>(*)
            %noun

            ~zod/try=> :type; `*`%noun
            1.853.189.998
            *

            ~zod/try=> -:!>(`*`%noun)
            %noun

            We can't show any examples producing %void - by definition, none of
            them would terminate. Because that's what %void means. All other
            cases in ++type are subsets of %noun.

        [%atom p=term]

            An atom is a natural number, with a term (known as an
            odor) that specificies an atomic subtype.

            An odor is an ASCII span. This span is a taxonomy which
            grows more specific to the right. For instance, @t
            for UTF-8 text, @ta for URL-safe ASCII text, @tas for
            a Hoon symbol; or @u for an unsigned integer, @ux for
            an unsigned integer formatted as hexadecimal.

            Hoon knows about the following odors, with defined meanings:

            @c              UTF-32 codepoint
            @d              date
              @da           absolute date
              @dr           relative date (ie, timespan)
            @f              yes or no (inverse boolean)
            @n              nil
            @p              phonemic base
            @r              IEEE floating-point
              @rd           double precision  (64 bits)
              @rh           half precision (16 bits)
              @rq           quad precision (128 bits)
              @rs           single precision (32 bits)
            @s              signed integer, sign bit low
              @sb           signed binary
              @sd           signed decimal
              @sv           signed base32
              @sw           signed base64
              @sx           signed hexadecimal
            @t              UTF-8 text (cord)
              @ta           ASCII text (span)
                @tas        ASCII symbol (term)
            @u              unsigned integer
              @ub           unsigned binary
              @ud           unsigned decimal
              @uv           unsigned base32
              @uw           unsigned base64
              @ux           unsigned hexadecimal

            Atoms change freely either up or down the taxonomy,
            but not across. You can treat a @tas as
            a @t, as in a strong type system; but you can also
            treat a @t as a @tas, or an @ as anything. However,
            passing a @t to a function that expects an @ux is a
            type error.

            Each of these forms has a URL-safe syntax. Each
            parses as an atomic constant in Hoon, and each is
            printed by the Hoon prettyprinter.

            ---
            The variety of units and formats which an atom can
            represent is essentially infinite. The set of
            syntaxes which Hoon can parse and print is
            fundamentally limited.

            For instance, Hoon has no syntax which means "number
            of miles." But within your program, nothing stops you
            from using the odor system to distinguish a number of
            miles from, for instance, a number of kilometers:

            ~zod/try=> `@udm`25.717
            25.717
            ~zod/try=> `@udk`25.717
            25.717

            The printer has no idea what a @udm is, but it knows
            what a @ud is and can print accordingly. Then, if you
            have a function which expects a @udm and you try to
            pass it a @udk, it will fail.
            ---

            Besides these prefixes, which indicate the rendering
            and/or meaning of atoms, the odor system has another
            orthogonal mechanism to restrict the size of atoms.
            Like the prefix, this mechanism is weak - it is not
            enforced and trivially evaded.

            An odor span contains two parts, both optional: a
            lowercase prefix and an uppercase suffix. The suffix,
            if present, is a single character A-Z c which
            indicates an atom of size less than or equal to n
            bits, where n is 1 << (c - 'A'). Thus, @tD is one
            UTF-8 byte (whatever that means); @tN is a kilobyte
            or less of UTF-8.

            When enforcing conversions, @t has no size
            information and can be used as @tD; and @tD, of
            course, can be used as @t. But using @tN as @tD is an
            error. There is no way to generate the smell of size
            from a constant without a cast. And of course
            arithmetic results have no odor at all.

            A full table for convenience:

            A   1 bit
            B   2 bits
            C   4 bits
            D   1 byte
            E   2 bytes
            F   4 bytes
            G   8 bytes
            H   16 bytes
            I   32 bytes
            J   64 bytes
            K   128 bytes
            L   256 bytes
            M   512 bytes
            N   1K
            O   2K
            P   4K
            Q   8K
            R   16K
            S   32K
            T   64K
            U   128K
            V   256K
            W   512K
            X   1MB
            Y   2MB
            Z   4MB

            You of course can build an atom larger than 4MB, but
            the type system cannot express a size odor above 4MB.


          [%bull p=twin q=type]

          [%cell p=type q=type]

              A pair of types. Set: all cells of p and q. 

              ~zod/try=> :type; [3 4]
              [3 4]
              [@ud @ud]

              ~zod/try=> -:!>([3 4])

              ~zod/try=> :type; [3 4]
              [3 4]
              [@ud @ud]

              ~zod/try=> -:!>([3 4])
              [%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]

          [%core p=type q=coil]

          [%cube p=* q=type]

              When we enter an ordinary constant, like 42, its type [%atom %ud]
              is the set of all atoms (with odor @ud, but any atom can have that
              or any odor). Its type is certainly not the set consisting
              exclusively of the value 42.

              But here's how we produce this "cubical" constant:

              ~zod/try=> :type; %42
              %42
              %42

              ~zod/try=> -:!>(%42)
              [%cube p=42 q=[%atom p=%ud]]
              
              In general, a %cube type contains p, a single noun, and q, a base
              type which provides semantics.

              Syntactically, any atomic constant can be preceded by % to generate
              a cube. The exception is @tas, which always needs % and is always
              cubical.

        [%face p=term q=type]

            A type is not just a set of nouns - it's also a meaning which makes
            sense of any noun in that set. The typed noun exports a namespace -
            give it a name, and it gives you another noun.

            ~zod/try=> foo=42
            foo=42
            ~zod/try=> :type; foo=42
            foo=42
            foo=@ud
            ~zod/try=> -:!>(foo=42)
            [%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]

            With %face, we've simply wrapped a label around another type. Note
            that this doesn't impair our ability to compute with the value.
            Computationally, foo=42 is just 42:

             ~zod/try=> (add 17 foo=42)
             59
             ---

        [%fork p=type q=type]

            A union type. [%fork p q] means "it could be a p, or maybe a q."

            Any branching computation in which different branches produce
            different types will generate a fork. For example:

            ~zod/try=> :type; ?:(& %foo [13 10])
            %foo
            { %foo [@ud @ud] }

            ~zod/try=> -:!>(?:(& %foo [13 10]))
            [ %fork
              p=[%cube p=7.303.014 q=[%atom p=%tas]]
              q=[%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]
             ]

            Here we start to understand why the type renderer is useful, as 
            { %foo [@ud @ud] } (which is not in any way Hoon syntax) is a 
            little easier to read than the actual type noun.

            (Readers of a mathematical bent may ask: since Hoon has a union
            type, where is the intersection type? There is none. Hoon is not
            one of these languages whose goal is to be as mathematically
            powerful as possible. Since a programming language is a UI for
            programmers, and programmers are not mathematicians, Hoon is
            designed to be as powerful as it has to be - and no more.)

++  mo
        make a map
  Description:
        Mapifiy.  Accepts a list of cells and produces a map of key-value pairs from the left-right cell pairs of the list.
        ---
        Creates a wet %gold gate which accepts a list, 'a'.
        Pushes the homogenized list onto the context.
        Casts the list 'a' to a list of cells whose left-right types correspond to the key-value type pairs.
        Let 'b' be the bunt of the map with the properly typed keys and values from the cell at the head of our list.
        Concatenate the elements of 'a' into the empty map of bunt 'b', and produce the result.

          Unless ben is a success, produce ben.
          Else unless ben contains an atom produce a crash of tax.
