        Declares the current Hoon version number in degrees Kelvin.

        In Kelvin versioning -the true Martian way to permanently freeze a
        system- releases count down by integer degrees Kelvin. At absolute
        zero, the system can no longer be changed.  At 1K, one more
        modification is possible. And so on.
