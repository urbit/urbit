**Describe and screenshoot the design issue**
A clear and concise description of what the design issue is. 
Is the observed issue an interface UX/usability issue? Is it a visual design issue? Is Indigo being used incorrectly?

As all user-facing design issues are likely to be visual to a degree, screenshots are mandatory for describing design issues.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce/view the behavior:

Example:
1. Click on dropdown
2. Note incorrectly-implemented Indigo component
4. Padding appears off by 2rem

**Expected design behavior**
A clear and concise description of how you expected the design to behave, look, feel, or be implemented.

If you are a designer involved directly as the point-person of the observed design issue, please include screenshot(s) of the intended design in your description of expected behavior. Link to the associated design if it exists.

If the observed design issue involves an Indigo component mis-implementation, please provide a link to the correct implementation of the component.
