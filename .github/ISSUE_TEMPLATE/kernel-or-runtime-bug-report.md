<!-- A good bug report, description of a crash, etc., should ideally be *reproducible*, with clear steps as to how another developer can replicate and examine your problem.  That said, this isn't always possible; some bugs depend on having created a complicated or unusual state, or can otherwise simply be difficult to trigger again (say, you encountered it in the last continuity era).

Your issue should thus at a minimum be *informative*.  The best advice here is probably "don't write bad issues," where "bad" is a matter of judgment and taste.  Issues that the maintainers don't judge to be sufficiently useful or informative may be closed. -->
