# Notes:
#
#   jobs.<job_id>
#
#     A seperate job id results in a lot of duplication of nix/cachix work.
#     The build will have to download any substituted derivations from cachix
#     for the steps with each distinct job id and upload built derivations to
#     cachix after each job has completed, either succesfully or on failure.
#
#   jobs.<job_id>.steps.run
#
#     build + test are distinct as each step entry results in a collapsable title
#     within the log output, which makes it easier to view failing builds or
#     tests independently.
#
#   jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast
#
#     Set to false so developers working on vere or king-haskell can have their
#     respective builds proceed without the other causing failure.
#
#   shell.nix
#
#     mkShell doesn't allow you to build it - so instantiate all the subshells
#     defined for the individual pkg/*/shell.nix as a sanity check and to create
#     some artefacts suitable for developers to pull from cachix. The top-level
#     shell.nix build time is dominated by Haskell dependencies so it's built as
#     part of the haskell build steps.
