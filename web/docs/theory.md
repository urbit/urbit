# Theory

The only single document with a general overview of Urbit is our
ginormous [whitepaper](theory/whitepaper).  The whitepaper has been
described as "sort of like a PhD thesis, but maybe more like
three PhD theses jammed into a single 40-page document."  Like 
Everest, it's there.

Some critics experience doubt that Urbit is actually a real
thing.  This is forgivable.  Sometimes, visual evidence will
correct these disturbed minds.  See our 2015 demo
[(part 1)](theory/part-i), [(part 2)](theory/part-ii), or our original
[2013 demo](theory/old).  But if the aliens could fake the moon
landings, they could certainly fake Urbit.
